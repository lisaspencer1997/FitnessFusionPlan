## About the Project

### Project Description

Our task for this project was to use everything we’ve learned over the course of this bootcamp to create a real-world client-side single-page application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

To that end, we have created an interactive dashboard app for the health conscious, which allows users to see, store and organise all their fitness-related data and tasks in a single place.

### Project Goal

In addition to practicing the skills we have acquired during this bootcamp, another main goal of this project was to experience working on a project as a team, deciding the best way to assign tasks and learning how to work across multiple branches in GitHub.

### Project Features

* A real-world client-side single-page application

* Has both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Polished front end/UI.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
